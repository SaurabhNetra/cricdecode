We invite you to use the App for maintaining your progress in cricket, but please note that your invitation is subject to your review and agreement with these Terms of Service. This document describes in detail your rights and our rights relating to the provision of the Services offered by us, so please review these Terms carefully.</span></p><h2 class="c3 c0"><a name="h.ct7v8olm8jjg"></a><span>What Are The Terms of Service?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Terms of Service constitutes a contract between us. If you do not agree to these Terms, you do not have the right to access or use our Service or purchase any products or services within the App. If you do register for or otherwise use our Service, or purchase any Scheme within the App, you shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of the Terms and your agreement to be a party to this binding contract.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>By using the App and purchasing any Schemes within the App, you acknowledge, accept and agree with all provisions of the Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, the use and treatment of your Account Information and your Content in accordance with such Privacy Policy.</span></p><h2 class="c3 c0"><a name="h.9ae9s7idupvr"></a><span>How does CricDeCode identify me as a unique user?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>In order to use the App, you need to login with your Facebook account. We use your Facebook ID as an identifier. If you purchase any schemes within the App, these purchases are tied to the Google Account, by which you have signed in on your device. Thus, you are a unique user &nbsp;to us with both your Facebook Login and Google Account on your device. </span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.7a4pi48vm2dr"></a><span>Why does CricDeCode use two accounts for identification?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>We have done this to ensure a double layer of security for your data, by relying on two companies, Facebook Inc. and Google Inc., which are known for their security. If either of these account of yours is hacked by a malicious user, double layer of security will ensure additional security of your data.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.l2kfbcusfvie"></a><span>What will happen to my data if I have purchased a new android device?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>If you have purchased a scheme on your previous device, ensure that you have signed in on your new device with the same Google Account. When you log in to CricDeCode, ensure that you use the same Facebook login. Only when you have registered with the same accounts, you would be able to continue to use the services that you have already purchased. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.78lp0tr16kp7"></a><span>How do I use CricDeCode on multiple devices?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>To use CricDeCode on multiple devices, you must be logged in with the same Facebook account and Google Account. </span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.kjpjdvbjlc3e"></a><span>What if I have changed my Facebook account?</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>If you have changed your Facebook Account and you have made purchases with your previous account, we will not be able to provide you with services of the previous account.
